* Etu's Slim Framework 4 Skeleton Application
This is an opinionated template for PHP projects using Slim Framework 4 that
has some care and thought put into error handling and logging.

It comes with the following custom bits:
 - Custom exceptions that supports something that works like PSR-3 context
   and specifying the log level for each exception type.
 - Custom error handler to handle these exceptions and log levels
 - Custom shutdown handler to log using the error handler

It's built on composer, Slim 4, PHP-DI, Monolog and Slim's PSR-7
implementation.

It also provides some response helpers to make it easier to write responses.
